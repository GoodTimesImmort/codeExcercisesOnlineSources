# Samples & Exercises

A collection of small scripts and exercises gathered from online tutorials as well as books.  
Every excercise was typed out to work on speed and accuracy. 
Some of the samples have notes where I added my own modifications or patches.
All credit goes to the creators of this knowledge.
