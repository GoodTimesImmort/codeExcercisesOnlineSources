# Samples & Exercises

A collection of small scripts and exercises gathered from online tutorials as well as books.
* Every exercise was typed, not copied, to work on speed and accuracy.
* Samples will have labeled personal comments of how I understood the code, also if I added any modifications or patches.
* All credit goes to the creators of this knowledge. Thank you for making it available.
